A homozygous nonsense mutation p.Glu27Ter in TRMT10A was identified using targeted next-generation sequencing and confirmed by PCR/Sanger sequencing. Diabetes was diagnosed while the subjects were in their 20s and was characterized by insulin resistance. Epilepsy and intellectual disability were features in common. Mild microcephaly was present at birth but their final head circumferences were normal.Our report provides independent confirmation of the role of TRMT10A mutations in this syndrome and expands its phenotypic description. TRMT10A sequencing should be considered in children or adults with young-onset diabetes who have a history of intellectual disability, microcephaly and epilepsy. This report also shows the advantages of using a targeted panel to identify previously unsuspected monogenic diabetes among young-onset non-insulin-dependent diabetes in the absence of obesity and autoimmunity.","affiliation":"Department of Medicine, National University Health System, Singapore.","language":"eng","pubModel":"Print","pubTypeList":{"pubType":["Case Reports"]},"grantsList":{"grant":[{"grantId":"102820","agency":"Wellcome Trust","orderIn":0},{"grantId":"098395","agency":"Wellcome Trust","orderIn":0}]},"subsetList":{"subset":[{"code":"IM","name":"Index Medicus"}]},"fullTextUrlList":{"fullTextUrl":[{"availability":"Subscription required","availabilityCode":"S","documentStyle":"doi","site":"DOI","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/dme.13024"}]},"isOpenAccess":"N","inEPMC":"N","inPMC":"N","hasPDF":"N","hasBook":"N","citedByCount":0,"hasReferences":"N","hasTextMinedTerms":"N","hasDbCrossReferences":"N","hasLabsLinks":"N","hasTMAccessionNumbers":"N","dateOfCreation":"2016-08-18","dateOfRevision":"2016-08-18","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-03"}]}}
