Variation in dysbindin, and its location on chromosome 6p, has been associated with cognitive processes, including those relying on a complex system of glutamatergic and dopaminergic interactions. Dysbindin is one of the seven protein subunits that comprise the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1). Dysbindin protein levels are lower in mice with null mutations in pallidin, another gene in the BLOC-1, and pallidin levels are lower in mice with null mutations in the dysbindin gene, suggesting that multiple subunit proteins must be present to form a functional oligomeric complex. Furthermore, pallidin and dysbindin have similar distribution patterns in a mouse and human brain. Here, we investigated whether the apparent correspondence of pallid and dysbindin at the level of gene expression is also found at the level of behavior. Hypothesizing a mutation leading to underexpression of either of these proteins should show similar phenotypic effects, we studied recognition memory in both strains using the novel object recognition task (NORT) and social novelty recognition task (SNRT). We found that mice with a null mutation in either gene are impaired on SNRT and NORT when compared with wild-type controls. These results support the conclusion that deficits consistent with recognition memory impairment, a cognitive function that is impaired in schizophrenia, result from either pallidin or dysbindin mutations, possibly through degradation of BLOC-1 expression and/or function.","affiliation":"Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.","language":"eng","pubModel":"Print-Electronic","pubTypeList":{"pubType":["Journal Article","Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]},"grantsList":{"grant":[{"grantId":"UL1-DE019580","agency":"NIDCR NIH HHS","acronym":"DE","orderIn":0},{"grantId":"RL1 MH083269","agency":"NIMH NIH HHS","acronym":"MH","orderIn":0}]},"keywordList":{"keyword":["Genetics","Memory","Schizophrenia","Object Recognition","Recognition Memory","Social Recognition","Dysbindin","Chromosome 6","Pallidin"]},"subsetList":{"subset":[{"code":"IM","name":"Index Medicus"}]},"fullTextUrlList":{"fullTextUrl":[{"availability":"Subscription required","availabilityCode":"S","documentStyle":"doi","site":"DOI","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gbb.12240"}]},"isOpenAccess":"N","inEPMC":"N","inPMC":"N","hasPDF":"N","hasBook":"N","citedByCount":0,"hasReferences":"N","hasTextMinedTerms":"N","hasDbCrossReferences":"N","hasLabsLinks":"N","hasTMAccessionNumbers":"N","dateOfCreation":"2016-01-15","electronicPublicationDate":"2015-09-10","firstPublicationDate":"2015-08-21"},{"id":"23563589","source":"MED","pmid":"23563589","doi":"10.1097/ypg.0b013e32836130a9","title":"An association study of the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 4 gene in schizophrenic patients.","authorString":"Saito A, Kuratomi G, Ito C, Matsuoka H, Suzuki T, Ozeki Y, Watanabe T, Fujii K, Shimoda K, Fukushima Y, Inukai T, Ohmori K, Akiyama K.","authorList":{"author":[{"fullName":"Saito A","firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Saito","initials":"A","affiliation":"Department of Biological Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Dokkyo Medical University School of Medicine, Mibu, Tochigi 321-0293, Japan."},{"fullName":"Kuratomi G","firstName":"Go","lastName":"Kuratomi","initials":"G"},{"fullName":"Ito C","firstName":"Chihiro","lastName":"Ito","initials":"C"},{"fullName":"Matsuoka H","firstName":"Hiroo","lastName":"Matsuoka","initials":"H"},{"fullName":"Suzuki T","firstName":"Tamio","lastName":"Suzuki","initials":"T"},{"fullName":"Ozeki Y","firstName":"Yuji","lastName":"Ozeki","initials":"Y"},{"fullName":"Watanabe T","firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Watanabe","initials":"T"},{"fullName":"Fujii K","firstName":"Kumiko","lastName":"Fujii","initials":"K"},{"fullName":"Shimoda K","firstName":"Kazutaka","lastName":"Shimoda","initials":"K"},{"fullName":"Fukushima Y","firstName":"Yasutsugu","lastName":"Fukushima","initials":"Y"},{"fullName":"Inukai T","firstName":"Toshihiko","lastName":"Inukai","initials":"T"},{"fullName":"Ohmori K","firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Ohmori","initials":"K"},{"fullName":"Akiyama K","firstName":"Kazufumi","lastName":"Akiyama","initials":"K"}]},"journalInfo":{"issue":"4","volume":"23","journalIssueId":2051906,"dateOfPublication":"2013 Aug","monthOfPublication":8,"yearOfPublication":2013,"printPublicationDate":"2013-08-01","journal":{"title":"Psychiatric genetics","medlineAbbreviation":"Psychiatr Genet","essn":"1473-5873","isoabbreviation":"Psychiatr.

As it is known that HPS is caused by a local mutation in one of the human genes, named HPS1 to HPS8 and PLDN (HPS9), encoding subunit proteins involved in endosomal trafficking pathways, here, we report the mutation causing the siblings disease and a case-control association study of schizophrenia using polymorphisms of a gene to be screened in the mutation analysis. METHODS: We analyzed three HPS-causing genes, HPS1, HPS4, and HPS7, to identify a genetic mutation involved in the siblings. A case-control association study of nine tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the entire genetic region of the HPS4 gene resulting from the screening in the siblings was carried out for schizophrenic patients (n=422) and controls (n=578). RESULTS: The two patients with HPS were homozygous for nonsense mutation (T/T) for the c.541C>T (rs119471022) in the HPS4 gene, which is mapped to human chromosome 22q12.1. The same nonsense mutation existed in the heterozygous state (C/T) in their mother and in two other siblings. The genotypic distribution of rs9608491 (C/T) in intron 4 showed a trend toward an association with schizophrenia as indicated by a corrected P-value of 0.053 controlling for multiple testing. Haplotype analyses showed that two of two-locus haplotypes, and all of three-locus, four-locus, and five-locus haplotypes, as they share rs9608491, yielded significant evidence for association with schizophrenia as shown by the following omnibus P-values. When rs4822724, rs61276843, rs9608491, rs713998, and rs2014410, five haplotype tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms, are assigned serial numerals (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), the omnibus P-values for the resulting haplotypes were P=0.0039 for 2-3, P=0.0142 for 3-4, P=0.0083 for 1-2-3, P=0.0187 for 2-3-4, P=0.0191 for 3-4-5, P=0.0270 for 1-2-3-4, P=0.0246 for 2-3-4-5, and 0.0261 for 1-2-3-4-5. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the HPS4 gene confers a susceptibility to schizophrenia.","affiliation":"Department of Biological Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Dokkyo Medical University School

disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. We tested this hypothesis by asking if mutations in the ASD gene MECP2 which cause Rett syndrome affect the expression of genes encoding the schizophrenia risk factor dysbindin, a subunit of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1), and associated interacting proteins. We measured mRNA and protein levels of key components of a dysbindin interaction network by, quantitative real time PCR and quantitative immunohistochemistry in hippocampal samples of wild-type and Mecp2 mutant mice. In addition, we confirmed results by performing immunohistochemistry of normal human hippocampus and quantitative qRT-PCR of human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived human neurons from Rett syndrome patients. We defined the distribution of the BLOC-1 subunit pallidin in human and mouse hippocampus and contrasted this distribution with that of symptomatic Mecp2 mutant mice. Neurons from mutant mice and Rett syndrome patients displayed selectively reduced levels of pallidin transcript. Pallidin immunoreactivity decreased in the hippocampus of symptomatic Mecp2 mutant mice, a feature most prominent at asymmetric synapses as determined by immunoelectron microcopy. Pallidin immunoreactivity decreased concomitantly with reduced BDNF content in the hippocampus of Mecp2 mice. Similarly, BDNF content was reduced in the hippocampus of BLOC-1 deficient mice suggesting that genetic defects in BLOC-1 are upstream of the BDNF phenotype in Mecp2 deficient mice. Our results demonstrate that the ASD-related gene Mecp2 regulates the expression of components belonging to the dysbindin interactome and these molecular differences may contribute to synaptic phenotypes that characterize Mecp2 deficiencies and ASD.","affiliation":"Department of Biology, Agnes Scott College, Decatur, Georgia, USA.","language":"eng","pubModel":"Electronic-Print","pubTypeList":{"pubType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]},"grantsList":{"grant":[{"grantId":"GM0099130-01","agency":"NIGMS NIH HHS","acronym":"GM","orderIn":0},{"grantId":"GM077569","agency":"NIGMS NIH HHS","acronym":"GM","orderIn":0},{"grantId":"K12 GM000680","agency":"NIGMS NIH HHS","acronym":"GM","orderIn":0},{"grantId":"UL1 RR025750","agency":"NCRR NIH HHS","acronym":"RR","orderIn":0},{"grantId":"NS-40593","agency":"NINDS NIH HHS","acronym":"NS","orderIn":0},{"grantId":"P30NS055077","agency":"NINDS NIH HHS","acronym":"NS","orderIn":0},{"grantId":"R01 GM077569","agency":"NIGMS NIH HHS","acronym":"GM","orderIn":0},{"grantId":"NS-065027","agency":"NINDS NIH HHS","acronym":"NS","orderIn":0}]},"meshHeadingList":{"meshHeading":[{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Hippocampus","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"CY","qualifierName":"cytology","majorTopic_YN":"Y"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Neurons","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"CY","qualifierName":"cytology","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"ME","qualifierName":"metabolism","majorTopic_YN":"Y"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Synapses","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"ME","qualifierName":"metabolism","majorTopic_YN":"Y"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Animals"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Humans"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Mice"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Carrier Proteins","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"GE","qualifierName":"genetics","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"ME","qualifierName":"metabolism","majorTopic_YN":"Y"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Lectins","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"GE","qualifierName":"genetics","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"ME","qualifierName":"metabolism","majorTopic_YN":"Y"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"RNA, Messenger","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"GE","qualifierName":"genetics","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"ME","qualifierName":"metabolism","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Computational Biology"},{"majorTopic_YN":"Y","descriptorName":"Gene Expression Regulation"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"DF","qualifierName":"deficiency","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"ME","qualifierName":"metabolism","majorTopic_YN":"Y"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"CY","qualifierName":"cytology","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Protein Interaction Maps"}]},"chemicalList":{"chemical":[{"name":"PLDN protein, human","registryNumber":"0"},{"name":"DTNBP1 protein, human","registryNumber":"0"},{"name":"RNA, Messenger","registryNumber":"0"},{"name":"Lectins","registryNumber":"0"},{"name":"Carrier Proteins","registryNumber":"0"},{"name":"Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2","registryNumber":"0"}]},"subsetList":{"subset":[{"code":"IM","name":"Index Medicus"}]},"fullTextUrlList":{"fullTextUrl":[{"availability":"Open access","availabilityCode":"OA","documentStyle":"pdf","site":"Europe_PMC","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3672180?pdf=render"},{"availability":"Open access","availabilityCode":"OA","documentStyle":"html","site":"Europe_PMC","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3672180"},{"availability":"Free","availabilityCode":"F","documentStyle":"pdf","site":"PubMedCentral","url":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=23750231&action=stream&blobtype=pdf"},{"availability":"Free","availabilityCode":"F","documentStyle":"html","site":"PubMedCentral","url":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=23750231"},{"availability":"Subscription required","availabilityCode":"S","documentStyle":"doi","site":"DOI","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0065069"}]},"isOpenAccess":"Y","inEPMC":"Y","inPMC":"Y","hasPDF":"Y","hasBook":"N","hasSuppl":"N","citedByCount":10,"hasReferences":"Y","hasTextMinedTerms":"Y","hasDbCrossReferences":"Y","dbCrossReferenceList":{"dbName":["UNIPROT"]},"hasLabsLinks":"N","hasTMAccessionNumbers":"N","dateOfCompletion":"2014-09-29","dateOfCreation":"2013-06-10","dateOfRevision":"2015-11-12","electronicPublicationDate":"2013-06-04","firstPublicationDate":"2013-06-04"}]}}
