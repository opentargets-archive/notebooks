By using the available omics data, including those from next-generation sequencing (NGS), genome-wide methylation profiling, candidate integrated genetic and epigenetic network (IGEN) analysis, and drug response genome-wide microarray analysis, we constructed an IGEN system based on three coupling regression models that characterize protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs), gene regulatory networks (GRNs), miRNA regulatory networks (MRNs), and epigenetic regulatory networks (ERNs). By applying system identification method and principal genome-wide network projection (PGNP) to IGEN analysis, we identified the core network biomarkers to investigate bladder carcinogenic mechanisms and design multiple drug combinations for treating bladder cancer with minimal side-effects. The progression of DNA repair and cell proliferation in stage 1 bladder cancer ultimately results not only in the derepression of miR-200a and miR-200b but also in the regulation of the TNF pathway to metastasis-related genes or proteins, cell proliferation, and DNA repair in stage 4 bladder cancer. We designed a multiple drug combination comprising gefitinib, estradiol, yohimbine, and fulvestrant for treating stage 1 bladder cancer with minimal side-effects, and another multiple drug combination comprising gefitinib, estradiol, chlorpromazine, and LY294002 for treating stage 4 bladder cancer with minimal side-effects.","affiliation":"Lab of Control and Systems Biology, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.","language":"eng","pubModel":"Print-Electronic","pubTypeList":{"pubType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"subsetList":{"subset":[{"code":"IM","name":"Index Medicus"}]},"fullTextUrlList":{"fullTextUrl":[{"availability":"Open access","availabilityCode":"OA","documentStyle":"pdf","site":"Europe_PMC","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4789422?pdf=render"},{"availability":"Open access","availabilityCode":"OA","documentStyle":"html","site":"Europe_PMC","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4789422"},{"availability":"Subscription required","availabilityCode":"S","documentStyle":"doi","site":"DOI","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/4149608"}]},"isOpenAccess":"Y","inEPMC":"Y","inPMC":"N","hasPDF":"Y","hasBook":"N","hasSuppl":"N","citedByCount":0,"hasReferences":"Y","hasTextMinedTerms":"Y","hasDbCrossReferences":"N","hasLabsLinks":"Y","hasTMAccessionNumbers":"N","dateOfCreation":"2016-04-01","dateOfRevision":"2016-04-04","electronicPublicationDate":"2016-02-29","firstPublicationDate":"2016-02-29"}]}}
