METHODS: The expression of SKP2 protein was detected in 89 NSCLC, 13 SCLC, 5 benign lung neoplasms, 5 normal bronchus and lung tissues by tissue chip and immunohistochemical techniques. RESULTS: The positive rate of SKP2 staining was (23.52 +/-13.57)% in NSCLC tissues and (53.85 +/- 12.26)% in SCLC tissues, significantly higher than (2.91 +/- 1.27)% in benign lung neoplasms and normal bronchus and lung tissues. Its expression was highest in SCLC tissues and lowest in benign lung tissues, with a significant difference between them (P <0.01). The expressive level of SKP2 protein in lung carcinoma tissues was closely related to cell differentiation and lymph node metastasis, but not to age, sex, smoking history, tumor site and size, and TNM staging, etc. The survival analysis revealed that the 5-year survival rate of lung carcinoma patients was much lower in SKP2 protein positive expression group than that in negative expression group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The positive expression of SKP2 protein is higher in lung carcinoma than in benign or normal lung tissues, in particular, much higher in SCLC tissue. Moreover, it may be an independent factor to exert negative influence on prognosis of patients with lung carcinoma.","affiliation":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical Univercity, Shenyang 110001, China.","language":"chi","pubModel":"Print","pubTypeList":{"pubType":["Journal Article","English Abstract"]},"meshHeadingList":{"meshHeading":[{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Lung","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"PA","qualifierName":"pathology","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"CH","qualifierName":"chemistry","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Bronchi","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"PA","qualifierName":"pathology","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"CH","qualifierName":"chemistry","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Humans"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Carcinoma, Small Cell","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"ME","qualifierName":"metabolism","majorTopic_YN":"Y"},{"abbreviation":"PA","qualifierName":"pathology","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"ME","qualifierName":"metabolism","majorTopic_YN":"Y"},{"abbreviation":"PA","qualifierName":"pathology","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Lung Neoplasms","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"ME","qualifierName":"metabolism","majorTopic_YN":"Y"},{"abbreviation":"PA","qualifierName":"pathology","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Lymphatic Metastasis"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"ME","qualifierName":"metabolism","majorTopic_YN":"Y"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Neoplasm Staging"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Prognosis"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Immunohistochemistry"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Survival Analysis"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Adolescent"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Adult"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Aged"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Female"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Male"}]},"chemicalList":{"chemical":[{"name":"S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins","registryNumber":"0"}]},"subsetList":{"subset":[{"code":"IM","name":"Index Medicus"}]},"isOpenAccess":"N","inEPMC":"N","inPMC":"N","hasPDF":"N","hasBook":"N","citedByCount":2,"hasReferences":"N","hasTextMinedTerms":"N","hasDbCrossReferences":"N","hasLabsLinks":"N","hasTMAccessionNumbers":"N","dateOfCompletion":"2008-05-05","dateOfCreation":"2007-08-31","firstPublicationDate":"2007-04-01"}]}}
